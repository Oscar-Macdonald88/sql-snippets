Welcome one, welcome all
To order, this toastmasters I do call!

Thanks to who took the time
To write a speech, I hope they rhyme!

The theme today, as you can see
is about children's poetry

Greatest authours like Dahl and Seuss
Have freed our minds to wander loose,

To play with words, to try new sounds
What wonders in them children have found!

And later in life, we just might find
Our skill with words has increased with time

All thanks to childrens poetry
which to this day give us glee.

There once was a man called Stephen
Who chose to be Grammarian
The word of the day, is nerd, don't you say?
And I'm sure we're all glad to see 'em.

There's another young man called Ian
Who's going to time as we're speakin'
If you go over time, I think you will find
That he'll stop you with strongest ambition!

Now let me show you Hamed
Who will keep track of the Ah's you've said
If you say quite a few, his face will turn blue,
and then pink, and then purple, then red!

First evaluator is Rob
Who likes to eat corn on the cob
He eats in his room, or I like to assume,
Otherwise this rhyme is a flop!

Our very first speaker today,
Is Rosie, a nice DBA
Her speech will be grand, so give her a hand,
and at the end you will all shout Hooray!

Next in line we have Jas,
To evaluate with much pizzazz
She is very kind, so keep that in mind
And please don't give her any sass

The one next to speak is called Aashi,
And her name rhymes well with nashi.
I'm sorry to say that my writing today
Is starting to be rather ghastly

Table Topics is Madhuri
who will give us all topics with fury.
I'm sorry, my rhymes have not improved over time
And I should have been tried by a jury.

I'll hand over to Stephen, who's hopin'
That my rhyming will stop him from mopin'
I'm happy to say, with kaloo and kalay
that toastmasters is officially OPEN!
