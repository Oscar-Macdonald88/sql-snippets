Using SSMS
Ctrl + Alt + G: View Registered Servers

Group server query:
Allows you to query a group of servers as if they were on the same server.
Ctrl + Alt + G: View Registered Servers
Right click on top level group folder (you can't use shift or ctrl click to highlight multiple servers, you have to use folders)
New Query
Query Window will show Connected (x/x)
To show all connected servers, run `SELECT @@servername AS Server`
 
for show more data in query: Tools -> Options -> Query Results -> SQL Server -> Multiserver Results

Import / Export Registered Servers
Right click top level group folder -> Tasks -> Export
Export to path or click on ellipse to browse. (extension .regsrvr)
If you have SQL accounts, make sure "Do not include user names and passwords in the export file" is checked.

Connecting to Central Management Server (CMS)
Lecturer's opinion: CMS is not good
Ctrl + Alt + G: View Registered Servers
Go to Database Engine -> Local Server Groups -> Right click Central Management Server -> Register Central Management Server...
Enter Server name, test, save.
Enter New Server Group or New Server Registration.

All the CMS is, is a way to register all your servers in once place so all network users can connect to your server, instead of exporting and exporting server groups.

Changing Options
Changing a really cool registered server option, or customizing appearance.
Ctrl + Alt + G: View Registered Servers
Rclick on server -> Properties.
Connection Properties -> Use custom color.
In Connection, open a query window. The bottom ribbon will have a different colour depending on which server you're connected to.

More options:
Tools -> Optimize
